## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
For this project, you will be building your project using IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) in a WGU-provided lab environment. You will be working with an existing MySQL database and Angular front-end, which are supplied for you in the lab environment. You will share this project to a private external GitLab repository and backup regularly. If you wish to work on it on your local machine, you will also need to download the Angular front-end application and create your own MySQL database. Use the links on your course page to install the integrated development environments (IDE), MySQL WorkBench, and IntelliJ IDEA, and pull the project from the lab environment.
